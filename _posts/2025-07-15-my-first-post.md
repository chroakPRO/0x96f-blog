Welcome to my blog! This is my first post using the Minimal Mistakes Jekyll theme.

## Getting Started

This is how you create a post in Jekyll. Each post goes in the `_posts` directory and follows the naming convention:

```
YYYY-MM-DD-title.md
```

## Front Matter

The section at the top between the `---` marks is called front matter. It contains metadata about your post:

- `layout`: The layout template to use (usually "single" for posts)
- `title`: The title of your post
- `date`: The publication date
- `categories`: Categories for organizing posts
- `tags`: Tags for more granular organization

## Writing Content

You can write your content using Markdown syntax. This includes:

- **Bold text**
- *Italic text*
- `Code snippets`
- [Links](https://example.com)
- Lists
- And much more!

Happy blogging!
